Sample Document for RAG Testing

This is a sample text document that demonstrates the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality of the LangGraph chatbot.

Key Features:
- Document loading from the rawdata folder
- Support for multiple file formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX, MD, CSV)
- Web scraping capabilities
- Vector storage using ChromaDB
- Semantic search and retrieval
- Context-aware responses

The chatbot can now:
1. Load documents from the rawdata folder
2. Scrape websites and add them to the knowledge base
3. Search through stored documents
4. Provide responses enhanced with relevant document context
5. Track all operations in LangSmith

This enables the chatbot to give more accurate and contextual responses based on your specific documents and data sources.
